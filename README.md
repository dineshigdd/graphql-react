# graphql-react
# This is a demo application:How to integrate Apollo GraphQL server and Client with React.js 
This application is for learning purpose. My intention is to show how to use GraphQL with React application.<br />
The Client-side is still not implemented

I use the Apollo GraphQL server in the development settings
to run the GraphQL server:<br />
`cd GraphQL-React\graphql-server`
`npm run dev`
The server will be at http://localhost:4000/

The code for the GraphQL server is at: `graphql-react/graphql-server`
