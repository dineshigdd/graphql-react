# graphql-react
#### This is a demo application to learn how to integrate Apollo GraphQL server and client with React.js 
#### The client-side is not yet implemented.

I use the Apollo GraphQL server. In the development settings to run the GraphQL server:<br />
`cd GraphQL-React\graphql-server`
`npm run dev`
The server will be at http://localhost:4000/

The code for the GraphQL server is at: `graphql-react/graphql-server`
